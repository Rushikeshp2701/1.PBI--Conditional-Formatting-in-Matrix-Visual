**Requirements**
Find a Power Query transformation that will change the individual lake columns into rows (you’ll end up with only three columns loaded into your data model)
Create a matrix visual that displays ice coverage by lake (on columns) and year (on rows)
Include major format options as seen in the sample, such as removing row and column totals
Find the “lake” you need to filter out and add a page-level or report-level filter to exclude it

**Matrix conditional formatting**
**Background Color**
Build a set of conditional formatting Rules (not the default gradient Color Scale option)
Use five different colors for ice coverage consisting of 0-24.99, 25-49.99, 50-74.99, 75-99.99, and 100

**Font Color**
Only use black (#000000) or white (#FFFFFF) font colors
Build and apply Rules so that the contrast between your background colors and white or black font color passes the accessibility test for WCAG AA at https://contrastchecker.com

**Icons**
Add a star next to any value where the maximum ice coverage is 100%
Add at least two supporting visuals around your matrix. You only have three fields, so be creative!

**Answer the following questions:**
Which lake has frozen completely over most often?
Is ice coverage trending *upward* over time for any lake?
